## 🎯 Best Practice Analyzer (BPA)

The Semantic Model MCP Server now includes a powerful **Best Practice Analyzer** that evaluates your semantic models against 71 comprehensive rules covering industry best practices and Microsoft recommendations.

### What is the BPA?

The Best Practice Analyzer automatically scans your semantic models (TMSL definitions) and identifies potential issues across multiple categories:

- **🚀 Performance** - Optimization recommendations for better query performance
- **💎 DAX Expressions** - Best practices for DAX syntax and patterns  
- **🔧 Maintenance** - Rules for model maintainability and documentation
- **📝 Naming Conventions** - Consistent naming standards
- **🎨 Formatting** - Proper formatting and display properties
- **⚠️ Error Prevention** - Common pitfalls and anti-patterns to avoid

### BPA Severity Levels

| Level | Name | Description | Example Issues |
|-------|------|-------------|----------------|
| 🔴 **ERROR (3)** | Critical | Must fix immediately | DAX syntax errors, model structure issues |
| 🟡 **WARNING (2)** | Important | Should address soon | Performance issues, suboptimal patterns |
| 🟢 **INFO (1)** | Suggestion | Continuous improvement | Formatting, documentation enhancements |

### BPA Tools Available

### Common BPA Violations and Fixes

#### 🚀 Performance Issues

**❌ Problem**: Using `double` data type for financial amounts
```json
"dataType": "double"
```
**✅ Solution**: Use `decimal` data type instead
```json
"dataType": "decimal"
```

**❌ Problem**: Foreign keys not hidden from end users
```json
"isHidden": false
```
**✅ Solution**: Hide foreign key columns
```json
"isHidden": true
```

#### 💎 DAX Expression Issues

**❌ Problem**: Using "/" operator for division
```dax
Average Price = [Total Sales] / [Total Quantity]
```
**✅ Solution**: Use DIVIDE() function to handle divide-by-zero
```dax
Average Price = DIVIDE([Total Sales], [Total Quantity])
```

**❌ Problem**: Unqualified column references
```dax
Total Sales = SUM(SalesAmount)
```
**✅ Solution**: Use fully qualified column references
```dax
Total Sales = SUM(Sales[SalesAmount])
```

#### 🎨 Formatting Issues

**❌ Problem**: Missing format strings on measures
```json
{
  "name": "Total Sales",
  "expression": "SUM(Sales[SalesAmount])"
}
```
**✅ Solution**: Add appropriate format string
```json
{
  "name": "Total Sales", 
  "expression": "SUM(Sales[SalesAmount])",
  "formatString": "#,0"
}
```

4. **Request Visualizations**: Ask "create a summary table" or "format the results nicely"
5. **Build on Previous Queries**: Reference earlier results to dive deeper into insights

### 🚀 **Getting Started Workflow**

1. **Start with Discovery**: `"What workspaces do I have access to?"`
2. **Explore Your Data**: `"Show me the structure of my [dataset name] model"`
3. **Ask Simple Questions**: `"How many rows of data do I have?"`
4. **Progress to Business Questions**: `"What are my top selling products?"`
5. **Dive into Analysis**: `"Show me trends and patterns in my sales data"`
6. **🆕 Ensure Quality**: `"Analyze my model for best practice violations"`

### 🎯 **Best Practice Analyzer Prompts**

**"Is my model following best practices?"**
```
#semantic_model_mcp_server analyze my [dataset name] model for best practice violations
```

**"What are the most critical issues in my model?"**
```
#semantic_model_mcp_server show me only ERROR level BPA violations in my model
```

**"How can I improve my model's performance?"**
```
#semantic_model_mcp_server get all performance-related BPA recommendations for my model
```

**"Check my DAX expressions for best practices"**
```
#semantic_model_mcp_server analyze DAX expressions in my model using BPA rules
```

**"Generate a quality report for my model"**
```
#semantic_model_mcp_server create a comprehensive BPA report for [dataset name]
```

**"What BPA categories should I focus on?"**
```
#semantic_model_mcp_server show me BPA violation counts by category and severity
```

**"Validate my TMSL before deployment"**
```
#semantic_model_mcp_server run BPA analysis on this TMSL definition to check for issues
```

### 📝 **Example Full Conversation**

```
You: "What workspaces do I have access to?"
AI: [Lists your workspaces using the MCP server]

You: "Show me the datasets in my 'Sales Analytics' workspace"
AI: [Lists datasets in that workspace]

You: "Get the structure of my 'Sales Model' dataset"
AI: [Retrieves TMDL definition showing tables, measures, relationships]

You: "Create a DirectLake model using the tables from my GeneratedData lakehouse"
AI: [Uses MCP server to list lakehouse tables and creates TMSL definition for DirectLake model]

You: "Now add a calculated measure for profit margin to this model"
AI: [Modifies the TMSL to include new measure and updates the model]

You: "Show me the relationships in this new model"
AI: [Retrieves updated TMSL definition and displays the relationships]

You: "That's interesting - can you show me the trend for the 'Electronics' category over time?"
AI: [Creates and runs a more specific DAX query for Electronics trends]
```

Remember: The AI assistant will use the MCP server tools automatically when you mention data analysis, DAX queries, or semantic model exploration in your prompts!
