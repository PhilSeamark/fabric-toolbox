## TMSL Reference
When working with TMSL (Tabular Model Scripting Language) objects, **strongly recommend** referring to the official Microsoft Learn documentation:
- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/analysis-services/tmsl/tmsl-reference-tabular-objects?view=sql-analysis-services-2025

This article provides the authoritative schema and syntax for TMSL objects including tables, columns, measures, relationships, and all valid properties. Always validate TMSL structure against this reference to ensure compliance and avoid deployment errors.

When creating new files in Agent mode to give output or summaries, always add them to the same subfolder called `output`.  These files should have a consistent header and include diagrams as much as possible.
